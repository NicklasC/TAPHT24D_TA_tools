<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Hi there! Here is a little introduction about me.
    </p>
<h2>Professional life</h2>
<p>I work as a technical tester, and have been doing that since 2005. Manual testing and test automation has been my thing =)</p>
<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>
    I like to attend different courses (like this one for example)... when I dont do that I train martial arts (Kickboxing, Krav Maga, Muay Thai)
    The spare time is limited though, as I am a father of three. You could say I am a taxi driver working part time ;)"
</p>
<h2>Some links...</h2>
<p>Here are two different martial art schools that I visit regularly.</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.kickboxing.se/">West Coast Kickboxing</a> - a really good kickboxing club<br>
    <a href="https://www.keiko.se/">Keiko Karate</a> - My sons karate club
